You are receiving this notification because your account meets this criteria and will be required to enroll in 2FA by June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC).  \r\n\r\n Please see the below FAQ, or learn more about 2fa on github help. (https://docs.github.com/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication)  \r\n\r\nWhat you need to know about the required 2FA initiative\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n We are enrolling GitHub users who manage or author code on GitHub. More information about our efforts to make 2FA adoption easy and safe can be found in this blog post. (https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13) This is a GitHub.com program, and unrelated to any organization or enterprise membership your account may have.  \r\n\r\nHow will this affect my account?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n On June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC) your account will be required to have 2FA for authentication. If you have not yet enrolled by that date, your ability to access GitHub.com will be limited until you finish the enrollment process.  \r\n\r\nHow do I enroll in 2FA?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n click here to get started! (https://github.com/settings/two_factor_authentication/setup/intro) Prior to June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC) you can follow the instructions in our documentation (https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication) to set up 2FA for your account. If you have not yet enrolled in 2FA by June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC), you will automatically be taken to the 2FA enrollment form the next time you access GitHub.com.  \r\n\r\nWhat forms of 2FA can I use?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n We want you to have the most seamless experience with 2FA possible, so you can choose one or more of the following options:   \r\nSecurity key \r\nGitHub Mobile \r\nAuthenticator application (TOTP) \r\nText messages (SMS) \r\n \r\n\r\n You should set up at least two of these options, to ensure you always have access to your account. Head to https://github.com/settings/security to enroll more 2FA methods.  \r\n\r\nI already have 2FA enabled, do I need to do anything?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n No, if you already have 2FA enabled before June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC), you don't need to take any additional actions. After June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC), you will no longer be able to unenroll from 2FA from your account, but you will be able to change the option you use for authenticating with 2FA. Additionally, you won't see any more banners on GitHub.com, and we won't email you about this anymore.  \r\n\r\nWhat happens to my PATs and SSH keys at the deadline?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Your PATs, SSH keys, and applications will all keep working after the deadline, regardless of your 2FA enrollment. PATs in particular are used extensively in important automation, and interruption there can cause outages in critical systems. However, when it is time to sign in to GitHub.com to create a new PAT or manage your account, you'll be required to enable 2FA before you can proceed.  \r\n\r\nWhat do I do if I lose my 2FA device?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n GitHub strongly encourages the use of multiple second factor options. If you lose all of your second factors, recovery codes are the only way to access your account again. By saving your recovery codes, you'll be able to regain access.  \r\n\r\n Be sure to enable cloud backup for your authenticator app and save your recovery codes. Many phones and computers can be security keys as well - registering them with GitHub.com gives you additional, highly-secure 2FA methods.  \r\n\r\n For security reasons, GitHub Support may not be able to restore access to accounts with 2FA enabled if you lose your 2FA credentials and lose access to your account recovery methods.  \r\n\r\n More information about recovery codes can be found on GitHub Help at https://docs.github.com/articles/recovering-your-account-if-you-lose-your-2fa-credentials  \r\n\r\nWhy is GitHub requiring 2FA?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Ensuring account security is a shared responsibility GitHub takes seriously. Strong authentication and the use of 2FA have been recognized as best practice for many years. We feel that GitHub has a duty to lead this push toward strong authentication as part of protecting the software supply chain.  \r\n\r\n To see this and other security events for your account, visit your account security audit log. (https://github.com/settings/security-log)  \r\n\r\n If you run into problems, please contact support by visiting the github support page.

Subscription Tickets allow access to view and manage all tickets created by all users across a tenant. The current ‚ÄòSupport Access‚Äô role will be deprecated.\n\nTenant Administrators will not automatically inherit the new ‚ÄòElevated Support Access‚Äô role and will need to explicitly add themselves to the role via the Auth0 Management Dashboard to continue to have access to view and manage all tickets across their tenant(s) via the Subscription Tickets feature. Tenant Administrators and all tenant members will still have access to the Auth0 Support Center to create and manage their own tickets without adding any additional roles.\n\n\nWhy are we making this change?\nIn order to increase the security of the Auth0 Support Center, the ‚ÄòSubscription Tickets‚Äô feature will be tied specifically to the new Elevated Support Access role so that access is not automatically inherited by all Tenant Admin users. This prevents roles from being able to see tickets they did not create without explicitly granting them access to do so.\n\n\nHow are you affected?\nYou have been identified as a Tenant Administrator for a tenant so you will lose access to view and manage all tickets¬†for your tenant on the ‚ÄòSubscription Tickets‚Äô page. You will still be able to access the Auth0 Support Center and create & manage the support tickets you created.\n\n\nWhat action do you need to take?\nIf you have a paid subscription, you can add yourself and any other users who need to see/manage all tickets (even those they did not create) across the tenant to the new Elevated Support Access¬†role from the Auth0 Management Dashboard. You should also review who currently has the legacy ‚ÄòSupport Access‚Äô role assigned and determine if they should be removed and/or added to have the new Elevated Support Access role.\n\nIf you are currently on a Free plan, there is no action required and this communication is to inform you that you will only be able to view and manage support tickets that you created.\n\n\nHow can you get additional assistance?\nWe are here to help.

You are receiving this notification because your account meets this criteria and will be required to enroll in 2FA by June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC).  \r\n\r\n Please see the below FAQ, or learn more about 2fa on github help. (https://docs.github.com/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication)  \r\n\r\nWhat you need to know about the required 2FA initiative\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n We are enrolling GitHub users who manage or author code on GitHub. More information about our efforts to make 2FA adoption easy and safe can be found in this blog post. (https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13) This is a GitHub.com program, and unrelated to any organization or enterprise membership your account may have.  \r\n\r\nHow will this affect my account?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n On June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC) your account will be required to have 2FA for authentication. If you have not yet enrolled by that date, your ability to access GitHub.com will be limited until you finish the enrollment process.  \r\n\r\nHow do I enroll in 2FA?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n click here to get started! (https://github.com/settings/two_factor_authentication/setup/intro) Prior to June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC) you can follow the instructions in our documentation (https://docs.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication) to set up 2FA for your account. If you have not yet enrolled in 2FA by June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC), you will automatically be taken to the 2FA enrollment form the next time you access GitHub.com.  \r\n\r\nWhat forms of 2FA can I use?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n We want you to have the most seamless experience with 2FA possible, so you can choose one or more of the following options:   \r\nSecurity key \r\nGitHub Mobile \r\nAuthenticator application (TOTP) \r\nText messages (SMS) \r\n \r\n\r\n You should set up at least two of these options, to ensure you always have access to your account. Head to https://github.com/settings/security to enroll more 2FA methods.  \r\n\r\nI already have 2FA enabled, do I need to do anything?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n No, if you already have 2FA enabled before June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC), you don't need to take any additional actions. After June 9th, 2024 at 00:00 (UTC), you will no longer be able to unenroll from 2FA from your account, but you will be able to change the option you use for authenticating with 2FA. Additionally, you won't see any more banners on GitHub.com, and we won't email you about this anymore.  \r\n\r\nWhat happens to my PATs and SSH keys at the deadline?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Your PATs, SSH keys, and applications will all keep working after the deadline, regardless of your 2FA enrollment. PATs in particular are used extensively in important automation, and interruption there can cause outages in critical systems. However, when it is time to sign in to GitHub.com to create a new PAT or manage your account, you'll be required to enable 2FA before you can proceed.  \r\n\r\nWhat do I do if I lose my 2FA device?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n GitHub strongly encourages the use of multiple second factor options. If you lose all of your second factors, recovery codes are the only way to access your account again. By saving your recovery codes, you'll be able to regain access.  \r\n\r\n Be sure to enable cloud backup for your authenticator app and save your recovery codes. Many phones and computers can be security keys as well - registering them with GitHub.com gives you additional, highly-secure 2FA methods.  \r\n\r\n For security reasons, GitHub Support may not be able to restore access to accounts with 2FA enabled if you lose your 2FA credentials and lose access to your account recovery methods.  \r\n\r\n More information about recovery codes can be found on GitHub Help at https://docs.github.com/articles/recovering-your-account-if-you-lose-your-2fa-credentials  \r\n\r\nWhy is GitHub requiring 2FA?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n Ensuring account security is a shared responsibility GitHub takes seriously. Strong authentication and the use of 2FA have been recognized as best practice for many years. We feel that GitHub has a duty to lead this push toward strong authentication as part of protecting the software supply chain.  \r\n\r\n To see this and other security events for your account, visit your account security audit log.
